# Still Strava - Quick Technical Walkthrough

## üéØ **Opening (30 seconds)**

_"Still Strava is a full-stack social app I built to demonstrate modern web development skills. It's like Strava but for mindful outdoor activities - hammocking, stargazing, nature walks. Let me walk you through the key features and technical implementation."_

---

## üîê **1. Authentication & Login (1 minute)**

### **What to Show:**

- Login with credentials
- Show user appears in navbar

### **What to Say:**

_"I implemented JWT-based authentication. When you log in, the server returns a JWT token that's stored in localStorage and sent with every API request. The frontend uses React Context to manage global user state, and passwords are hashed with bcrypt on the backend."_

**Key Technical Points:**

- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- React Context for global state management
- bcrypt password hashing

## üìù **2. Creating a New Activity (2 minutes)**

### **What to Show:**

- Fill out form fields
- Upload photos with drag & drop
- Select location on map
- Submit form

### **What to Say:**

_"Activity creation combines several technical features. The form uses controlled components connected to React state for real-time validation. The photo upload compresses images client-side using Canvas API before sending to the server, reducing file sizes by 60-80%. For location, I integrated Google Maps API with reverse geocoding. When submitted, the data goes to my Flask API which uses SQLAlchemy ORM to create the database record."_

**Key Technical Points:**

- Controlled components with React state
- Client-side image compression with Canvas API
- Google Maps API integration
- Flask + SQLAlchemy backend processing

---

## üè† **3. Activity Feed & Real-time Updates (1.5 minutes)**

### **What to Show:**

- Show activity feed
- Like an activity (show count updates immediately)
- Add a comment

### **What to Say:**

_"The activity feed demonstrates real-time updates without page refreshes. When you like an activity, I update the parent component's state after the API call, which triggers a re-render with the new like count. I chose React Context over Redux for state management because it's simpler for this scale."_

**Key Technical Points:**

- Real-time updates via state management
- Parent-child component communication
- React Context vs Redux decision

---

## üë• **4. User Search & Social Features (1 minute)**

### **What to Show:**

- Type in search box (show real-time filtering)
- Follow/unfollow a user

### **What to Say:**

_"The user search filters in real-time as you type using React's useState and useEffect. The follow system uses a many-to-many database relationship with a Follow model that connects users. SQLAlchemy automatically handles the relationship loading."_

**Key Technical Points:**

- Real-time filtering with React hooks
- Many-to-many database relationships
- SQLAlchemy relationship management

---

## üìä **5. User Statistics Dashboard (1 minute)**

### **What to Show:**

- Navigate to user profile
- Show charts (line, pie, calendar)

### **What to Say:**

_"I integrated Chart.js for data visualization. The backend processes raw activity data to create chart-friendly datasets, and I optimized the queries to avoid N+1 problems by loading all necessary data in a single request."_

**Key Technical Points:**

- Chart.js integration
- Data processing and aggregation
- Query optimization

---

## üó∫Ô∏è **6. Map Integration (30 seconds)**

### **What to Show:**

- Click on activity with location
- Show map with marker

### **What to Say:**

_"The map integration uses Google Maps API. Coordinates are stored in the database and used to place markers. The API key is stored in environment variables for security."_

**Key Technical Points:**

- Google Maps API integration
- Coordinate storage and display
- Environment variable security

---

## üîß **7. Technical Deep Dive (1 minute)**

### **What to Show:**

- Open browser dev tools
- Show Network tab with API calls

### **What to Say:**

_"You can see the RESTful API calls in the Network tab. I use proper HTTP status codes and comprehensive error handling. The database has 5 core models with proper relationships, and all endpoints require JWT authentication except login and signup."_

**Key Technical Points:**

- RESTful API design
- HTTP status codes
- Database relationships
- JWT authentication

---

## üöÄ **8. Closing (30 seconds)**

### **What to Say:**

_"This project demonstrates full-stack development with modern frameworks. I focused on clean code, proper error handling, and user experience. For production, I'd migrate to PostgreSQL, implement cloud storage, and add proper logging and monitoring."_

**Key Technical Achievements:**

- Full-stack development
- Real-time updates
- Client-side image compression
- Comprehensive error handling
- Responsive design

## üó£Ô∏è **Quick Transition Phrases**

- _"Now let me show you..."_
- _"This demonstrates..."_
- _"Here's an interesting technical challenge I solved..."_
- _"The key technical concept here is..."_

---

## ‚ùì **Quick Answers to Common Questions**

### **"Why this tech stack?"**

_"React for component reusability and strong ecosystem, Flask for Python's readability and rapid development, SQLAlchemy for type-safe database operations, and JWT for stateless authentication."_

### **"How would you scale this?"**

_"PostgreSQL for production database, AWS S3 for image storage, Redis for caching, and containerization with Docker for deployment."_

### **"What was most challenging?"**

_"Implementing real-time updates for likes and comments without page refreshes. I solved it by updating parent component state after API calls."_

### **"How do you handle errors?"**

_"Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks, proper HTTP status codes, user-friendly error messages, and database rollbacks on failures."_
