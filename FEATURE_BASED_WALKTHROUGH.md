# Still Strava - Feature-Based Technical Walkthrough

## üéØ **Opening (30 seconds)**

_"Still Strava is a full-stack social app I built to demonstrate modern web development skills. It's like Strava but for mindful outdoor activities - hammocking, stargazing, nature walks. Let me walk you through the key features and some of the technical aspects of the project."_

---

## üîê **1. Authentication & Login (2 minutes)**

### **What to Show:**

- Navigate to login page
- Enter credentials and log in
- Show user profile appears in navbar

### **What to Say:**

_"I implemented JWT-based authentication - when you log in, the server validates your credentials and returns a JWT token. This token is stored in localStorage and sent with every API request in the Authorization header."_

**Technical Points:**

- _"The frontend uses React Context to manage global user state - when the app loads, it checks for an existing token and automatically logs you in if it's valid"_
- _"On the backend, I use Flask-JWT-Extended for token generation and validation"_
- _"Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage - you'll never see plain text passwords in the database"_
- _"The token includes user ID and expiration time, making it stateless and scalable"_

### **Code to Reference:**

```javascript
// UserContext.js - Auto-login on app load
useEffect(() => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
  if (token) {
    fetch(getApiUrl("/me"), {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
    });
  }
}, []);
```

## üìù **2. Creating a New Activity (3 minutes)**

### **What to Show:**

- Click "New Activity" button
- Fill out form fields (title, description, activity type)
- Upload photos using drag & drop
- Select location on map
- Submit the form

### **What to Say:**

_"Now let me show you activity creation - this is where several technical features come together."_

**Form Handling:**

- _"The form uses controlled components - every input is connected to React state, so I have real-time validation and can prevent invalid submissions"_
- _"I implemented client-side validation that checks required fields and provides immediate feedback"_

**Photo Upload System:**

- _"The photo upload is one of my favorite features. I built a custom drag & drop interface that accepts multiple files"_
- _"Before uploading, images are compressed client-side using Canvas API - this reduces file sizes by 60-80% without noticeable quality loss"_
- _"The compression happens in the browser, so large files never hit the server, improving performance"_
- _"I use FormData to send files to the backend, and the server validates file types and sizes for security"_

**Google Maps Integration:**

- _"For location selection, I integrated Google Maps API. When you click on the map, it uses reverse geocoding to convert coordinates to a readable address"_
- _"The coordinates are stored in the database, and I can display the exact location on activity cards"_

**Backend Processing:**

- _"When you submit, the form data goes to my Flask API. I use SQLAlchemy ORM to create the database record with proper foreign key relationships"_
- _"The server validates all inputs server-side and returns appropriate error messages if anything fails"_

### **Code to Reference:**

```javascript
// Image compression before upload
const compressImage = (file) => {
  const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
  const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  // Resize and compress logic
};
```

## üè† **3. Activity Feed & Real-time Updates (2 minutes)**

### **What to Show:**

- Navigate to home page
- Show activity feed with multiple posts
- Like an activity (show count updates)
- Add a comment
- Show the like count updates without page refresh

### **What to Say:**

_"The activity feed demonstrates several key technical concepts."_

**Data Fetching:**

- _"The feed loads activities from my RESTful API. I use React's useEffect hook to fetch data when the component mounts"_
- _"The API returns activities with nested user data and like information - I use SQLAlchemy relationships to efficiently load related data"_

**Real-time Updates:**

- _"Here's an interesting challenge I solved - when you like an activity, the count updates immediately without refreshing the page"_
- _"I implemented this by updating the parent component's state after a successful API call. The ActivityActionButtons component receives the activities array and setter function as props"_
- _"When you like something, it updates the local state, which triggers a re-render with the new like count"_

**State Management:**

- _"I chose React Context over Redux for state management because it's simpler for this scale and provides all the functionality I need"_
- _"The activities are stored in local component state, but user authentication is managed globally through UserContext"_

### **Code to Reference:**

```javascript
// Real-time like update
const handleLike = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(apiUrl, { method: "POST" });
  const data = await response.json();

  // Update parent component's state
  const updatedActivities = activities.map((activity) =>
    activity.id === data.id
      ? { ...activity, like_count: data.like_count }
      : activity
  );
  setActivities(updatedActivities);
};
```

## üë• **4. User Search & Social Features (2 minutes)**

### **What to Show:**

- Navigate to "Find Friends" page
- Type in search box (show real-time filtering)
- Click follow/unfollow on a user
- Show the follow status updates

### **What to Say:**

_"The user search demonstrates real-time filtering and social features."_

**Real-time Search:**

- _"As you type, the search filters users in real-time. I use React's useState and useEffect to debounce the search input"_
- _"The search happens client-side for instant results, but I could easily add server-side search for larger datasets"_

**Follow System:**

- _"The follow system uses a many-to-many relationship in the database. I have a Follow model that connects users with follower_id and followed_id"_
- _"When you follow someone, it creates a new Follow record, and when you unfollow, it deletes the record"_
- _"The UI updates immediately by toggling the button state and updating the follow count"_

**Database Relationships:**

- _"This is a good example of SQLAlchemy relationships. The User model has 'following' and 'followers' relationships that automatically load the related Follow records"_

### **Code to Reference:**

```python
# Follow model with proper relationships
class Follow(db.Model):
    follower_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'))
    followed_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'))

    follower = db.relationship('User', foreign_keys=[follower_id])
    followed = db.relationship('User', foreign_keys=[followed_id])
```

## üìä **5. User Statistics Dashboard (2 minutes)**

### **What to Show:**

- Navigate to a user profile
- Show the statistics section with charts
- Point out different chart types (line chart, pie chart, calendar)

### **What to Say:**

_"The statistics dashboard shows data visualization and complex data processing."_

**Chart.js Integration:**

- _"I integrated Chart.js for professional-looking data visualization. The charts are responsive and interactive"_
- _"The line chart shows weekly activity trends, the pie chart breaks down activity types, and the calendar shows activity intensity over time"_

**Data Processing:**

- _"The backend processes raw activity data to create chart-friendly datasets. For example, the weekly chart groups activities by week and calculates totals"_
- _"The calendar heatmap uses a custom algorithm to determine color intensity based on activity duration"_

**Performance Considerations:**

- _"I optimized the queries to load all necessary data in a single request, avoiding N+1 query problems"_
- _"The charts only render when the data is available, preventing errors and improving user experience"_

### **Code to Reference:**

```javascript
// Chart data processing
const weeklyData = activities.reduce((acc, activity) => {
  const week = getWeek(activity.datetime);
  acc[week] = (acc[week] || 0) + activity.elapsed_time;
  return acc;
}, {});
```

## üè∑Ô∏è **6. Badge System (1 minute)**

### **What to Show:**

- Navigate to badges section
- Show earned vs unearned badges
- Explain how badges are calculated

### **What to Say:**

_"The badge system demonstrates business logic and data aggregation."_

**Badge Logic:**

- _"Badges are calculated dynamically based on user activity data. I have functions that check various criteria like activity count, duration, and diversity"_
- _"The system is extensible - I can easily add new badge types by adding new calculation functions"_

**Database Efficiency:**

- _"Instead of storing badge states in the database, I calculate them on-demand. This keeps the data normalized and ensures badges are always accurate"_

---

## üó∫Ô∏è **7. Map Integration (1 minute)**

### **What to Show:**

- Click on an activity with a location
- Show the map display
- Point out the location marker

### **What to Say:**

_"The map integration shows third-party API usage and data visualization."_

**Google Maps API:**

- _"I integrated Google Maps API for location display. The coordinates are stored in the database and used to place markers on the map"_
- _"The map component is reusable - it can display single locations or multiple markers for activity clusters"_

**API Key Management:**

- _"The Google Maps API key is stored in environment variables for security. In production, I'd use a more sophisticated key management system"_

---

## üîß **8. Technical Deep Dive (2 minutes)**

### **What to Show:**

- Open browser dev tools
- Show Network tab with API calls
- Show the database structure in code
- Point out error handling

### **What to Say:**

_"Let me show you the technical implementation details."_

**API Architecture:**

- _"You can see the RESTful API calls in the Network tab. Each feature makes specific HTTP requests to my Flask backend"_
- _"I use proper HTTP status codes - 200 for success, 400 for validation errors, 401 for authentication issues"_

**Database Design:**

- _"The database has 5 core models with proper relationships. I use foreign keys and cascade deletes to maintain data integrity"_
- _"SQLAlchemy handles the ORM mapping, so I can work with Python objects instead of raw SQL"_

**Error Handling:**

- _"I implemented comprehensive error handling. If an API call fails, the user sees a friendly error message instead of a technical error"_
- _"The backend validates all inputs and returns appropriate error responses"_

**Security:**

- _"All API endpoints require authentication except login and signup. The JWT token is validated on every request"_
- _"File uploads are validated for type and size, and filenames are sanitized to prevent security issues"_
