        <h3>The Story Behind Still Strava</h3>
        <div className="inspiration-content">
          <p>
            I've always loved Strava - the way it connects athletes, celebrates
            achievements, and builds community around physical activity. But
            when I broke my ankle and couldn't run, bike, or do the
            high-intensity activities I was used to, I found myself missing that
            sense of connection and outdoor engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still Strava was born from that experience. I wanted to create a
            space where people could connect with others and spend time
            outdoors, but in a more accessible way. Whether you're recovering
            from an injury, prefer slower activities, or just want to celebrate
            the peaceful moments in nature, this is a place for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, we track the quiet activities that bring us closer to nature -
            hammocking, stargazing, bird watching, or simply sitting by a lake.
            It's about finding joy in the stillness and sharing those moments
            with others who understand.
